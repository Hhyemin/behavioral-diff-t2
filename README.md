This repository has only 1 file with 2 functions: 
 * __split_lists__: split a list into several sub-lists.
 * __print_splitted_lists_in_order__: print the sub-lists in a specified order.  

_Note: More details in the docstring._

### Three PRs:
* **#1 Code changes in function _split_lists_ only.** The changes in this function are functionally equivalent, meaning that for any given input, the output remains the same as before. 

* **#2 Code changes in function _print_splitted_lists_in_order_ only.** The function has been updated to allow for random-order printing. Note: A random seed is used to ensure consistent output for the same input.

* **#3 Code changes in both functions.** This PR enables testing or creating test cases for each function individually, or for the entire file (covering both functions) if applicable.
